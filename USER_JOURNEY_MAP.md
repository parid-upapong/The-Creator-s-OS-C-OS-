# User Journey Map: From Hero Content to Viral Proliferation

| Phase | User Action | System Process | Emotional State |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Ingestion** | Creator uploads a 20-min YouTube video link. | System fetches video, generates transcript, and identifies "High-Energy" segments. | Hopeful / Excited |
| **2. Selection** | User reviews 10 AI-suggested "Short Clips" and selects the best 3. | System presents clips with viral potential scores and "Hooks." | Curious / Empowered |
| **3. Refinement** | User tweaks the AI-generated LinkedIn post and adjusts caption colors on a TikTok clip. | Real-time preview of edits; AI suggests alternative headlines for better CTR. | Creative / Focused |
| **4. Adaptation** | User clicks "Globalize" to generate Spanish and Thai dubbed versions. | AI applies Voice Synthesis (Cloning) and Lip-Syncing for the target languages. | Impressed |
| **5. Distribution** | User hits "Schedule All" to push to 5 different platforms. | System handles API handshakes and queues posts according to optimal timing. | Relieved / Satisfied |
| **6. Analysis** | User checks the dashboard to see which adapted format performed best. | Aggregates data from all APIs into a unified "Content Health" score. | Informed / Strategic |

## Key Friction Points to Solve:
- **Uploading Speed:** Large files can be slow; implement chunked uploading.
- **AI Hallucinations:** Ensure the blog post generator doesn't invent facts not present in the video.
- **API Limits:** Handle platform rate-limiting gracefully to ensure posts never fail.
